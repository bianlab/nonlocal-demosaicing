# denoiser
This directory contains the denoisers used in this paper. Total variation (TV) denoiser for GAP-TV, Weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) denoiser for DeSCI, and video block-matching and 4-D filtering (V-BM4D) denoiser for DeSCI-VBM4D.
## TV
The TV denoiser is adapted from the GAP-TV code by [Xin Yuan](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/x.yuan "Xin Yuan, Bell labs"). Please cite the GAP-TV paper if you use the TV denoiser for GAP-TV.

## WNNM
The WNNM denoiser for video denoising is adapted from the WNNM denoiser for image denoising proposed by [Shuhang Gu](https://sites.google.com/site/shuhanggu/home), [Lei Zhang](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/), Wangmeng Zuo, and Xiangchu Feng. We download the original WNNM image denoiser from the author(s) personal website (available on http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/code/WNNM_code.zip).
Please cite the WNNM paper if you use the WNNM image denoiser.

## VBM4D
The VBM4D denoiser is downloaded from the [BM3D](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/ "block-matching and 3-D filtering") website (available on http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/VBM4D_v1.zip). We use VBM4D instead of VBM3D nor BM4D because VBM4D contains noise estimation, which eliminates the need to estimate the noise level of the alternating projection process compared with VBM3D, and VBM4D outperforms BM4D in terms of videos.
Please cite the VBM4D paper is you use the VBM4D denoiser.

# spectrumRGB
This directory contains the wavelength-to-RGB converter, that is the spectrumRGB package. The spectrumRGB package is used in the demonstration of the spectral reconstruction results, not in the main recovery process of DeSCI. This pakage is downloaded from the File Exchange portal of the MATLAB Central [Spectral and XYZ Color Functions](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7021-spectral-and-xyz-color-functions "Spectral and XYZ Color Functions - File Exchange - MATLAB Central") by [Jeff Mather](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/869511-jeff-mather "Jeff Mather").
