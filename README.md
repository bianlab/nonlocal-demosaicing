*Figure1. Recovered images of different methods under different MSFAs. The close-ups and corresponding error maps are shown in the right side of each image. Compared with the other methods, the proposed method enables higher-Ô¨Ådelity details and fewer artifacts, and maintains the state-of-the-art performance for different mosaic patterns and channels.*
